# SMS-spam Detection

SMS spam detection is a process used to identify and filter out unsolicited or unwanted text messages sent to mobile phones. It involves analyzing the content and characteristics of text messages to determine whether they are spam or legitimate messages. Techniques such as machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and pattern recognition are commonly used to automatically classify incoming messages as spam or not spam based on features such as keywords, message length, sender information, and frequency of messages. SMS spam detection helps users protect their privacy, prevent fraudulent activities, and maintain the security of their mobile devices.
